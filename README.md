 # Cchar-Cjair

Cchar and Cjair are programming languages similar to Rust and C++. This project includes a lexer for Cchar, which is 40% complete. The lexer for Cjair has not been started yet.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run the code, you need to have `g++` installed on your system.

### Compilation

To compile the code, use the following command:
```sh
g++ main.cpp -o main

.\main
If you see an error message like this:

Error C3789 common: CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE! Buffer Overflow Detected! Hello, I think I see 
some segmentation faults and memory leaks in compiling. To avoid catastrophic failure, do not proceed with 
<./exe ./file char file>. Immediate action required!!

it means you have done 90% of the work.

.\main ./main.chr

You should see output similar to this:

Type: accessner, Value: .
Type: keyword, Value: gobul
Type: operator, Value: (

or it can be big

I’m not sure why I’m uploading this to GitHub, but here it is!
